            <p>Hi there! I'm Gabriel Chan, a fresh graduate with a diploma in Game Development & Technology. My journey into the world of game development began in my childhood, where the aspects of games sparked a passion that has only grown stronger over the years.
                <br>
                <br>I've always wondered the scenes behind the making of a game whenever I'm playing, reading or watching them. I remember my first multiplayer game that I was exposed to, <i>Maplestory</i>, which was a really old and extremely popular MMORPG back in its prime, it's also still currently alive. As I navigated through the game, I couldn't help but wonder about the mechanics that brought it to life â€” the physics of the Flash Jumps, the complexities of content management, and even the frustrations caused by certain game mechanics. These reflections fueled my curiosity about game development.
                <br>
                <br>Like many others, my passion for games led me to want to make my own. However, I was also cautious of my career path as the game industry is a bit of a skeptical path in where I live - Singapore. Hence, I decided to pursue a diploma in Game Development & Technology at Nanyang Polytechnic as it provides not just skills for the development of games but also more technical software engineering skills. As such, I've learnt many skills in Nanyang Polytechnic that are transferrable to other IT career paths such as developing programs from scratch, web development, project management and many more! Overall, I enjoyed my course of studies and the different fields that I was exposed to.
                <br>
                <br>After experiencing and being exposed to game development, I now found this new passion for yet another aspect of gaming that I enjoy. I seek to improve and acquire new skills and plan to further my studies as a developer. My goal in life is to live with fullfilment. I want to live doing what I enjoy doing. Developing software applications and games has shown me that for now, I want to create an experience for everyone to enjoy, and digitally is how I'll achieve it.

The combat uses scam tricks for the scammers to attack you and you can defend yourself by fighting back with skills inspired by actions you can take to avoid falling prey to scams. 
                    <br>I led a team of 4 and developed this game for a project in NYP. I developed the <span class="highlightPoints">skills system(combat)</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">inventory(to store and equip the skills)</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">shops(to purchase skills)</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">level design and implementation.</span>

                <p class="projectDesc"> Perrail is a <span class="highlightPoints">3D turn-based roguelike RPG developed on Unity</span>. I created Perrail out from heavy inspiration of popular turn-based RPGs like <i>Persona 5, Honkai: Star Rail, Epic Seven</i>. 
                    <br>I enjoyed these games very much and wanted to learn to make my own. I also wanted to further improve my code structure and architect so I decided to add in <span class="highlightPoints">roguelike elements</span> to learn and also to spice up the gameplay.
                    <br>The combat of Perrail features <span class="highlightPoints">skills that have their own multipliers and conditions</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">an algorithm for the turn order that is proportional to the characters' speed</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">character animations</span> and tons of other mechanics! This independant project was a real test to my software architect and huge learning curve for me.
