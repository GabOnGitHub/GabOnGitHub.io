            <p>I have had a passion for games throughout my life, playing a wide variety on various platforms. This enthusiasm drove me to explore the world of game development. Consequently, I pursued a diploma in Game Development & Technologies at Nanyang Polytechnic and graduated. My interests are mostly indoor-based, including playing, watching, reading, and reviewing games, films, and anime. I also derive great pleasure from dining out and savoring good, affordable food, an appreciation I owe to someone special. Moreover, I occasionally dabble in simple cooking and baking, though my culinary skills remain a work in progress.</p>

The combat uses scam tricks for the scammers to attack you and you can defend yourself by fighting back with skills inspired by actions you can take to avoid falling prey to scams. 
                    <br>I led a team of 4 and developed this game for a project in NYP.

                <p class="projectDesc"> Perrail is a <span class="highlightPoints">3D turn-based roguelike RPG developed on Unity</span>. I created Perrail out from heavy inspiration of popular turn-based RPGs like <i>Persona 5, Honkai: Star Rail, Epic Seven</i>. 
                    <br>I enjoyed these games very much and wanted to learn to make my own. I also wanted to further improve my code structure and architect so I decided to add in <span class="highlightPoints">roguelike elements</span> to learn and also to spice up the gameplay.
                    <br>The combat of Perrail features <span class="highlightPoints">skills that have their own multipliers and conditions</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">an algorithm for the turn order that is proportional to the characters' speed</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">character animations</span> and tons of other mechanics! This independant project was a real test to my software architect and huge learning curve for me.
