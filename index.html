            <p>Hi there! I'm Gabriel Chan, a fresh graduate with a diploma in <i>Game Development & Technology</i>. My journey into the world of game development began in my childhood, where the aspects of games sparked a passion that has only grown stronger over the years.
                <br>
                <br>I've always wondered about the scenes behind the making of a game whenever I'm playing, reading, or watching them. I vividly recall my first exposure to a multiplayer game, <i>Maplestory</i>, a once incredibly popular MMORPG that still thrives today. Navigating through the game, I couldn't help but ponder the mechanics that brought it to lifeâ€”the physics of the Flash Jumps, the complexities of content management, and even the frustrations caused by certain game mechanics. These reflections fueled my curiosity about game development.
                <br>
                <br>Like many others, my passion for games led me to aspire to create my own. However, I approached my career path with caution, considering the skepticism surrounding the game industry in Singapore. Consequently, I decided to pursue a diploma in <i>Game Development & Technology</i> at Nanyang Polytechnic. This program not only equipped me with game development skills but also provided a foundation in technical software engineering
                <br>
                <br>Throughout my studies at Nanyang Polytechnic, I acquired various transferrable skills applicable to other IT career paths, such as developing programs from scratch, web development, and project management. Overall, I enjoyed the diverse fields I was exposed to during my course.
                <br>
                <br>After immersing myself in game development, I discovered a newfound passion for another aspect of gaming. Eager to improve and acquire new skills, I have plans to further my studies as a developer. My goal in life is to live with fulfillment, doing what I enjoy. Developing software applications and games has revealed that, for now, creating digital experiences is my path to achieving that goal.

The combat uses scam tricks for the scammers to attack you and you can defend yourself by fighting back with skills inspired by actions you can take to avoid falling prey to scams. 
                    <br>I led a team of 4 and developed this game for a project in NYP. I developed the <span class="highlightPoints">skills system(combat)</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">inventory(to store and equip the skills)</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">shops(to purchase skills)</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">level design and implementation.</span>

                    <br>I enjoyed these games very much and wanted to learn to make my own. I also wanted to further improve my code structure and architect so I decided to add in <span class="highlightPoints">roguelike elements</span> to learn and also to spice up the gameplay.
                    <br>The combat of Perrail features <span class="highlightPoints">skills that have their own multipliers and conditions</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">an algorithm for the turn order that is proportional to the characters' speed</span>, <span class="highlightPoints">character animations</span> and tons of other mechanics! This independant project was a real test to my software architect and huge learning curve for me.
